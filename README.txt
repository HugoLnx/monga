Tests
There are three types of test:
 	* Files named as "testname.in": 
    * If exists a file named "testname.expected", the runner compare its content with the program output.
    * If not, our runner expects that the program rejects the input.
 	* Files named as "testname.rejected":
    * Each line represents a test case that should be rejected.
